         <p class="about-description">Hey there!</p>
         <p class="about-description"> My name is Tiffany and I like to create things. I'm an aspiring product manager currently majoring in computer science with a minor in data science. Outside of academics,
           I love to expand my horizons on campus with different student organizations.</p>
         <p class="about-description">At <a href="https://www.codeology.club" target="_blank">Codeology</a> , a software club, I serve as Media Officer and get the chance to explore my artistic side, designing their recruitment materials and leading publicity efforts. I also have the chance to work on side projects with other club mates. My latest were a Spotify Classifier and To-Do List App. </p>
         <p class = "about-description"> On the other hand, I am also a part of <a href="https://www.berkeley-pbl.com" target="_blank">Phi Beta Lambda</a>, a national business organization, where I take part as Consulting Chair. I lead a group of 5 students and teach them consulting fundamentals through
           real life case studies throughout the semester. It is a really enriching experience to pass on your knowledge to others!</p>
         <p class="about-description">If I'm not petting dogs or in a club meeting, I love to spend time with my apartment mates making brunch, shopping or just having a heart-to-heart.</p>
         <p class="about-description-below">Say hi!
