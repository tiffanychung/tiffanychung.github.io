         <p class="about-description">Hey there!</p>
         <p class="about-description"> My name is Tiffany and I like to create things. I'm an aspiring product manager currently a junior at UC Berkeley studying computer science. I recently wrapped up a summer at Oracle as a Product
           Management intern. Learn more about my experiene with this <a href="https://medium.com/@tiffchung/my-product-management-internship-oracle-f763e30f848c?source=friends_link&sk=945ebc43834cbd648025c2c1eed9014f" target="_blank">Medium article</a> I wrote! Outside of academics,
           I love to expand my horizons on campus with different student organizations.</p>
         <p class="about-description">At <a href="https://www.codeology.club" target="_blank">Codeology</a> , a software club, I serve as Director of Media and get the chance to explore my artistic side, spearheading recruitment efforts and curating content for our online platofrms. I also have the chance to work on side projects with other club mates. My latest were a Spotify Classifier and Music Generation. </p>
         <p class = "about-description"> On the other hand, I am also a part of <a href="https://www.berkeley-pbl.com" target="_blank">Phi Beta Lambda</a>, a national business organization, where I take part as Consulting Chair. I lead a group of 5 students and teach them consulting fundamentals through
           real life case studies throughout the semester. It is a really enriching experience to pass on your knowledge to others!</p>
         <p class="about-description">If I'm not petting dogs or in a club meeting, I love to eat brunch, paint or listen to lofi tunes on Youtube.</p>
